    "Your ONLY job is to output valid JSON that follows the schema below. "
    "Rules you must always follow:\n"
    "1. Respond with JSON ONLY. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text.\n"
    "2. Always include ALL top-level keys, even if values are null or empty.\n"
    "3. If information is missing, unclear, or not present, return null for single values, "
    "or an empty array [] for lists.\n"
    "4. Parse numbers as numbers (age: int, total_amount.amount: float). Parse booleans as true/false.\n"
    "5. Dates must be ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) if present, otherwise null.\n"
    "6. Medications must be split into three parts:\n"
    "   - name: the generic or brand drug name (e.g., 'DOXYCYCLINE TABLETS')\n"
    "   - dosage: the strength and form (e.g., '100MG', '2% 15G', '100ML')\n"
    "   - quantity: the number of units dispensed (e.g., '1', '2 packs')\n"
    "   Do not leave dosage null if it can be parsed from the string.\n"
    "   If the document only lists a generic line item such as 'Medication' (without further details), "
    "   then include it as {\"name\": \"Medication\", \"dosage\": null, \"quantity\": \"1\"} instead of leaving the list empty.\n"

    "   $ or 'USD' → USD\n"
    "   KSh or 'KES' or 'Kenyan Shillings' → KES\n"
    "- If no symbol is present, infer currency from country/location context:\n"
    "   If the provider name, address, phone code, email domain, or website indicate Kenya (.ke, Eldoret, Nairobi, +254, etc.) → KES\n"
    "   If the provider/location clearly indicates Nigeria (.ng, Lagos, Abuja, ₦, etc.) → NGN\n"
    "   If the provider/location clearly indicates USA (.us, state names, $ without clarification, etc.) → USD\n"
    "- If no evidence for currency is found, return null.\n"
    "- Do not guess without textual or location evidence.\n\n"
    "Example medication parsing:\n"
    "- 'DOXYCYCLINE 100MG TABLETS' → {\"name\": \"DOXYCYCLINE TABLETS\", \"dosage\": \"100MG\", \"quantity\": \"1\"}\n"
